# AI-powered spatiotemporal imputation and prediction of chlorophyll-a concentration in coastal oceans
This repository contains the code for the STIMP method, an advanced AI framework to impute and predict Chl_a across a broad spatiotemporal scale in coastal oceans. STIMP's results can be utilized to diagnose and analyze the ecosystem health of coastal oceans based on the remote sensing measurement.
